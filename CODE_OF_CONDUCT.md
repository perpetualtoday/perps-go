Perpetual Today is founded upon the principles of truth, integrity and a complete disregard for bias. Ethical journalism aims to ensure the open, correct and comprehensive sharing of facts. It is the dignity of a responsible journalist.

This page describes these 4 values as the cornerstone of professional news gathering, adapted from the [Society of Professional Journalists](https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp)' Code of Ethics. It urges all members of this organization to follow them.



## Always Seek and Report the Truth
Honesty is the heart of Perpetual Today, and journalism should be accurate and honest. Journalists must be truthful in presenting and publishing facts and information.

#### Members should

* Professionally keep their reporting correct. Until release, check the details using primary references as much as possible. 

* Remember that the speed nor format excuses inaccuracy of information. 

* Always give context. Be vigilant not to simplify or complicate the information excessively. 

* Specify and clearly distinguish the origin of the information. The public has the right to as much as information and determine its authenticity.

* Before pledging for confidentiality of identity, consider the sources' motivations. Store confidentiality for sources who may be subject to danger, liability or other harm and do not provide any details anywhere. Explain that there has been confidentiality to protect the sources' welfare.

* Give voice to the voiceless.

* Encourage free and respectful exchanges of opinions, regardless of off-putting opinions.

* Include, where applicable and necessary, links to the source of information.

* Avoid stereotyping. Journalists must look at how their beliefs and perceptions influence their reporting.

* Clearly distinguish journalism from advocacy or opinion.

* Never alter evidence or any fact whatsoever, visually or textually. Illustrations and re-enactments should be specifically described.

## Protection Against Harm
